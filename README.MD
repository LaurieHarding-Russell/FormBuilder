## What is this?
This is a library for creating form components in C++. It is heavily influenced by html, css, and the Angular Framework.

## WHY?
For fun? Also, seperating concerns like html and css allows for easier developement of more complex UX. Lets be honest, Web developers make better looking buttons/inputs then any other flavor of programmer. 

That being said we can do better. CSS has to be backward compatable. This has lead to quirks/complexity in the language. (What's up with css stacking order?) I don't need to worry about the world. You can run with whichever version of this library you want. When things start getting quirky I can fix them withought worrying about breaking users.

Am I being pretentious? Yup. Will anyone ever use this library? Probably not. Would I recommend it to a friend? Only if they want to contribute and make it a lot better!
